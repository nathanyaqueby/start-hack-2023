# ðŸ’¸ FinVerse - START Hack 2023

Globally, only 1-in-3 adults are 'financially literate'. Access to financial data and financial data insights are often presented in ways that are boring and difficult to interpret for the average user. Our mission is to make financial data easier to *interpret, interact, understand* and *visualize*.

Presenting [FinVerse](https://six-cutting-edge.streamlit.app/), a VR financial literacy platform developed during the START Hack 2023.
